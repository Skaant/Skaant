## Hi there !

I'm Romaric Ruga,
* aka [RIMAROK](https://rimarok.com) (the freelance web-developer)
* aka [IMROK](https://imrok.fr) (the polyvalent creator).

## Tinker, engineer, artist

My **passion about software** *design & development* is driven by the will to **give my creations shapes on the internet**.

> Back to my teen years, I always felt the urge to use computers and to build things online.
> 
> Since my mother bought us an internet connection I started to customize forums, host my static websites and create some JS/PHP algorithms.

After my *computer science/company management* master degree, **I immediately started my freelance life**.

Five years later, I'm still an independant web-developper, with a **serious interest for sustainable IT** and a quite sensible approach.

Currently **my main skills are** :
* Front-end development (SASS, TypeScript, React),
* Back-end development (Node, PHP),
* Testing (Jest),
* CI/CD automation (Actions, Travis).

**I'm also found of patterns !**

## My GitHub's projects

### Historic projects

During the last years, I played with various JS full-stack technologies.

The following are archived but meaningful projects :

* **PERMA-DATA**, a long-time and multi-versioned ([1](https://github.com/Skaant/permadata), 2, [3](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-3), [4⭐](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-4), [5⭐✨](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-5)) full-stack project that made me use ES6, React, Firebase, Bulma, Express, Mongo, Bootstrap, Heroku and more.

  My first aim was to provide data about plants, from a wide range of sources.

  I also experienced some aspects of **gamification**, to make data import more fun.

* **MOTIFS JS**. Working on PERMA-DATA and micro JS apps, I found myself trying to re-use some parts of my code

  > At this point the concept of patterns did really hit me.
  
  I started to work on **motifs-js** to abstract and share common patterns between my various project.
  
  At first it was a _project/file system_ patterns library (v. [0.1](https://github.com/Skaant/_motif-js_0.1), [0.2](https://github.com/Skaant/_motif-js_0.2)) but I soon made it a **static website generator** (v. [1](https://github.com/Skaant/motifs-js)) (I'll explain my choice for JAM stack below).
  
  There, I also built a test framework inspired by Jest (but I won't do it again lol).
  
  I stopped this project after discovering Gatsby and finding out it'd be a pain to refactor the codebase from JS to TS.
  
  The documentation website can still be found at this url : [https://motifs-js-website-imrok.vercel.app/](https://motifs-js-website-imrok.vercel.app/). You'd find the answer of the question [what is a MOTIF ?](https://motifs-js-website-imrok.vercel.app/motifs/motif#what-is-a-motif-).
  
 * I also [made a small analytic script](https://github.com/Skaant/nalytimk-functions) for me and my girlfriend's websites,
 
 * [I started to work on a web-crawler](https://github.com/Skaant/bulbapedia-crawler) to harvest Bublbapedia's Pokémon data.

  This was meant to provision [my Pokémon team builder app](https://poke-team.net/).
  
### Current projects

Due to my profesional schedule, I'm not working on "big" projects on my own anymore.

Instead **I found practical, valuable and more self-centered uses** of my developer skills.

> Global consciousness

After doing some researches about ecological impacts of numeric activities, I took a deep dive into JAM stack.

Times after I discovered Gatsby, I started to replace wy websites' sources (built with my own `motifs-js` framework, see above) with this technology.

* **HIGHBS-BOK.** The most advanced product I made (and maintain) is my [*deep optimistic SF* book's website](https://highbs-bok.art) website.

  The repository can be found at this url : [https://github.com/Skaant/highbs-bok](https://github.com/Skaant/highbs-bok).

* **IMROK.** [I'm also currently refactoring my creative website](https://github.com/Skaant/imrok-next),

* **RIMAROK.** Also planned is a rework of my profesional website.

  Update is scheduled for 2022 S2, as a consequence of a sustainable _IT/sober design and developement_ formation to come.
