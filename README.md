## Hi there !

I'm Romaric Ruga,

- aka. [RIMAROK](https://rimarok.com) (freelance web-developer)
- aka. [IMROK](https://imrok.fr) (multipotent creator).

## Tinker, engineer, artist

My **passion about software** *design & development* is driven by the will to **give my creations a shape on the internet**.

> Back to my teen years, I always felt the urge to use computers and to build things online.
> 
> Since my mother bought us an internet connection I started to customize forums, host my static websites and create some JS/PHP algorithms.

After my *computer science/company management* (MIAGE) **master degree**, in 2016, I immediately **started my freelance life**.

Seven years later, I'm still roxxing as an **independant web-developper**, with a **serious interest for sustainable IT** and a quite sensible approach.

Currently **my main skills are** :
* Front-end development (TypeScript, React, SASS),
* Back-end development (Node, PHP),
* Testing (Jest),
* CI/CD automation (Actions, Travis).

**I'm also found of patterns !** 
  
## Current projects

### Nebula ✨

Nebula is a solution coupling Notion, Gatsby and GitHub CI/CD for a user-friendly data management interface and automated static website refresh.

The main attempt is to create a more light and sustainable alternative to CMS like WordPress.

- [`nebula-genesis`](https://github.com/abstract-core/nebula-genesis), is cloned from the actual Github repo **to fetch data from Notion API and to cache it**,
- [`nebula-atoms`](https://github.com/abstract-core/nebula-atoms), is a set of Gatsby/React templates, components and types to import in projects.

The actual project and process can be seen on the `astraliko-nebula` folder.

Some of the following website projects also embody this stack.

### [RIMAROK.com](https://rimarok.com), freelance 🤖 dev web 🌻 éco-conception

- [`rimarok`](https://github.com/Skaant/rimarok), my web developper professional website.

### [IMROK.fr](https://imrok.fr), le hub créatif de Romaric Ruga

- [`imrok`](https://github.com/Skaant/imrok), my creative blog for various thoughts sharing.

### [HIGHBS-BOK](https://highbs-bok.art), le livre du motif absolu

- [`highbs-bok`](https://github.com/Skaant/highbs-bok), my deep optimistic book saga's website.

## Historic projects

During the last years, I played with various JS full-stack technologies.

The following are archived but meaningful projects :

### PERMA-DATA

- [v5⭐✨](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-5),
- [v4⭐](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-4),
- [v3](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-3),
- [v1](https://github.com/Skaant/permadata).
-
- A long-time and multi-versioned full-stack project that made me use ES6, React, Firebase, Bulma, Express, Mongo, Bootstrap, Heroku and more.
 
> My goal was to provide data about plants, from a wide range of sources.
>
> I also experienced some aspects of **gamification**, to make data import more fun.

### MOTIFS-JS

- [`motif-js_0.1`](https://github.com/Skaant/_motif-js_0.1)`,
- [`motif-js_0.2`](https://github.com/Skaant/_motif-js_0.2)`,
- [`motifs-js`](https://github.com/Skaant/motifs-js).
 
**Working on PERMA-DATA and micro JS apps, I found myself trying to re-use some parts of my code**

  > At this point the concept of patterns did really hit me.

 #### The multiple purposes changes of this project
 
 - At first it was a _project/file system_ patterns library (ex: read some JS/MD files),
 - But it soon became a **static website generator**.
     
Then I discovered Gatsby and re-oriented the project to cover both aspect of my website generation system, that I was previously providing through this framework :

> [`nebula-genesis`](https://github.com/abstract-core/nebula-genesis), to query and fetch the website content,
> [`nebula-atoms`](https://github.com/abstract-core/nebula-atoms), to display fetched content.
