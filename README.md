## Hi there !

I'm Romaric Ruga,
* aka [RIMAROK](https://rimarok.com) (the freelance web-developer)
* aka [IMROK](https://imrok.fr) (the polyvalent creator).

## Tinker, engineer, artist

My **passion about software** *design & development* is driven by the will to **give my creations a shape on the internet**.

> Back to my teen years, I always felt the urge to use computers and to build things online.
> 
> Since my mother bought us an internet connection I started to customize forums, host my static websites and create some JS/PHP algorithms.

After my *computer science/company management* (MIAGE) **master degree**, in 2016, I immediately **started my freelance life**.

Seven years later, I'm still roxxing as an **independant web-developper**, with a **serious interest for sustainable IT** and a quite sensible approach.

Currently **my main skills are** :
* Front-end development (TypeScript, React, SASS),
* Back-end development (Node, PHP),
* Testing (Jest),
* CI/CD automation (Actions, Travis).

**I'm also found of patterns !** 
  
## Current projects

### Nebula ‚ú®

Nebula is a solution coupling Notion, Gatsby and GitHub CI/CD for a user-friendly data management interface and automated static website refresh.

The main attempt is to create a more light and sustainable alternative to CMS like WordPress.

- `nebula-genesis`, is cloned from the actual Github repo **to fetch data from Notion API and to cache it**,
- `nebula-atoms`, is a set of Gatsby/React templates, components and types to import in projects.

The actual project and process can be seen on the `astraliko-nebula` folder.

Some of the following website projects also embody this stack.

### [RIMAROK.com, freelance ü§ñ dev web üåª √©co-conception](https://rimarok.com)

### [HIGHBS-BOK, le livre du motif absolu](https://highbs-bok.art)** The most advanced product I made (and maintain) is my [*deep optimistic SF* book's website](https://highbs-bok.art) website.

- [`highbs-bok`](https://github.com/Skaant/highbs-bok), my deep optimistic book saga's website.

## Historic projects

During the last years, I played with various JS full-stack technologies.

The following are archived but meaningful projects :

* **PERMA-DATA**, a long-time and multi-versioned ([1](https://github.com/Skaant/permadata), 2, [3](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-3), [4‚≠ê](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-4), [5‚≠ê‚ú®](https://github.com/Skaant/perma-data-5)) full-stack project that made me use ES6, React, Firebase, Bulma, Express, Mongo, Bootstrap, Heroku and more.

  My first aim was to provide data about plants, from a wide range of sources.

  I also experienced some aspects of **gamification**, to make data import more fun.

* **MOTIFS JS**. Working on PERMA-DATA and micro JS apps, I found myself trying to re-use some parts of my code

  > At this point the concept of patterns did really hit me.
  
  I started to work on **motifs-js** to abstract and share common patterns between my various project.
  
  At first it was a _project/file system_ patterns library (v. [0.1](https://github.com/Skaant/_motif-js_0.1), [0.2](https://github.com/Skaant/_motif-js_0.2)) but I soon made it a **static website generator** (v. [1‚≠ê‚ú®](https://github.com/Skaant/motifs-js)) (I'll explain my choice for JAM stack below).
  
  There, I also built a test framework inspired by Jest (but I won't do it again lol).
  
  I stopped this project after discovering Gatsby and finding out it'd be a pain to refactor the codebase from JS to TS.
  
 The documentation website can still be found at this url : [https://motifs-js-website-imrok.vercel.app/](https://motifs-js-website-imrok.vercel.app/). You'd find the answer of the question [what is a MOTIF ?](https://motifs-js-website-imrok.vercel.app/motifs/motif#what-is-a-motif-).
  
* I also [made a small analytic script](https://github.com/Skaant/nalytimk-functions) for my girlfriend's and I websites,
 
* [I started to work on a web-crawler](https://github.com/Skaant/bulbapedia-crawler) to harvest Bublbapedia's Pok√©mon data.

  This was meant to provision [my Pok√©mon team builder app](https://poke-team.net/).

  Update is scheduled for 2022 S2, as a consequence of a sustainable _IT/sober design and developement_ formation to come.
